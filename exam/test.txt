Ten little Crip niggaz runnin outside
All from the turf and they bangin out lives
Far from a scrub cuzz from the Eastside
Where they don't die they just multiply
So.. don't give them niggaz a reason
To turn it into spray season
Don't give them niggaz a reason
Because they'll turn it into Crip season
The gangsta's back, the bank is fat
